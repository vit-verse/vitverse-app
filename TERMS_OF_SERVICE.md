- Community features (Cab Share, Lost & Found, Faculty Ratings, Events)
- Campus utilities (mess menu, laundry tracking, PYQ)

You agree to:

## 4. Data and Privacy

Your VTOP credentials are encrypted (AES-256) and stored locally on your device. The app fetches academic data directly from VTOP servers and stores it locally. **We do not collect, store, or transmit your credentials to our servers.**

Community feature participation (Cab Share, Lost & Found, Events) may display your name and registration number to other users. Faculty ratings do not display personal details with ratings, but comments show "Commented by" to prevent spam.

Push notifications are delivered via Firebase Cloud Messaging using topic-based subscriptions (no tokens stored). You can unsubscribe from notification topics in the Notification Settings page.

For complete data handling details, see our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
